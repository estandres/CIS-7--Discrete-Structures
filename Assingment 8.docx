The most helpful video in the series was the recurrence relations video. Mainly because it had helped me in understanding and constructing my code for the fibonacci sequence. I hadn't really heard of the fibonacci sequence before and found his breakdown and explanation of it very helpful when I tried to conceptualize how I would construct my code logic. It also helped me get familiarized with finding patterns in a given set or series which honestly also came in handy in my Differential Equations class when we had to construct a summation from a given differential equation.
